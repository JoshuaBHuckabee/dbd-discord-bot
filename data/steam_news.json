arrives next week, so let\u2019s check out the notable gameplay changes you can expect from this public test build. plus, stay tuned for next week's ptb patch notes where we\u2019ll share the precise values that are changing for each of the topics below!\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">read on for all the details:\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><div class=\"bb_h2\">new features\u00a0</div><div class=\"bb_h3\">slugging reduction update\u00a0\u00a0</div><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img

state for a total of 90 seconds during a match, they gain the ability to pick themselves up after fully recovering.\u00a0</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">added the option to enable or disable this mechanic in custom games.\u00a0</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>note: perks that enable you to recover from the dying state - like boon: exponential - will continue to function as before, without needing to meet this requirement.</i>\u00a0</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">gradually increases crawling speed for survivors who are left in the dying state.\u00a0</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">added the ability for survivors to recover while crawling. recovery now occurs passively with no need to hold a button.\u00a0</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">updated several survivor and killer perks to account for these changes.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><b>dev note</b>: when it comes to slugging, we know it can be frustrating if you're on the receiving end of it too often or for too long, but we also know that sometimes it's the smart move. this updated system acknowledges this, allowing the killer to slug occasionally when they feel like it's the right call, but will eventually kick in and swing in the survivor's favour if slugging is used excessively.</i>\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>a big part of this is also about making the experience of being slugged more pleasant (as much as being slugged can be, at least). the recovery changes and crawling speed will give you a bit more agency when downed so you aren't just holding a button and waiting for someone to come save you.</i>\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><div class=\"bb_h3\">tunneling reduction update\u00a0</div><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0<img src=\"https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/11814497/0482917169463155a4eb21457ead88298ad3d4ab.png\" /></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">when a survivor is hooked, their hook status is hidden from the killer. when they\u2019re unhooked, there is no notification and their hook status isn\u2019t revealed immediately.\u00a0</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">this is disabled once all generators are completed.\u00a0</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">unhooked survivors gain the following effects for a limited time:\u00a0</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">haste, endurance, and elusive (see below) status effects.\u00a0</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">no collision with other players (both killer and survivor).\u00a0</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">immunity to killer instinct and sees the killer\u2019s aura nearby.\u00a0</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">these effects are lost when the affected survivor perform a conspicuous action.\u00a0</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">all these effects (except haste and endurance) are disabled once all generators are completed.\u00a0</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">added a unique effect to the killer hook state ui that indicates the last survivor they hooked.\u00a0</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">after completing a \u201cunique hook\u201d (the same survivor is not hooked consecutively), killers get the following benefits:\u00a0</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">bonus damage for the next generator kick.\u00a0</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">temporary haste status effect.\u00a0</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">temporarily reveals survivors (think basekit bbq & chili) that have less or equal hook states to the hooked survivor.\u00a0</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">these effects are slightly lessened for the blight, the dark lord, the ghoul, the hillbilly, and the nurse.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">these effects are disabled once all generators are completed.\u00a0</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">added new effects that disincentivize tunneling:\u00a0</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">if a survivor dies before 6 total hook states, all remaining survivors gain a repair speed bonus for the rest of the trial.\u00a0</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">if the survivor that was last hooked is sacrificed or killed, generators cannot be regressed or blocked.\u00a0</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">added the option to enable or disable these new mechanics in custom games.\u00a0</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">updated several survivor and killer perks to account for these changes.\u00a0</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><b>dev note</b>: it\u2019s no secret that tunneling can be seen as an efficient way to play for killers. while this can be true, it\u2019s also true that the results of this can be frustrating for survivors, leading to trials ending too quickly for some, while leaving others to fend for themselves in a match that is now much more difficult.</i>\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>the intention here is for both roles to feel the benefits and incentives that come from spreading hook states. on the one end, survivors have better opportunities to evade and reset after unhooks, while also limiting those tough situations where losing a survivor too quickly causes things to go south quickly and snowball. on the other end, killers are able to apply more map pressure to push back against efficient teams, covering ground post-hook and strengthening gen regression.</i>\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><div class=\"bb_h3\">elusive status effect\u00a0</div><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img src=\"https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/11814497/14e4a3b0a91493fb7ead7f44042e561e22f046c7.png\" /></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">added a new status effect that silences grunts of pain and suppresses survivor aura, pools of blood, and scratch marks.\u00a0</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><b>dev note</b>: to start, we\u2019ll be using this new status effect as part of the tunnelling reduction update, but plan to integrate this into relevant existing perks down the road to make their descriptions more streamlined. arguably the easiest way to look at this is a survivor version of undetectable, in that when it\u2019s active, you know you\u2019re in stealth mode.</i>\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><div class=\"bb_h3\">\u201cthe tomes\u201d lore update\u00a0</div><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0<img

tome.\u00a0</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><b>dev note</b>: ever since we reworked the tome, we\u2019ve seen how much you\u2019ve yearned for more lore. we\u2019re happy to share that beginning with 9.2.0, lore is back! while previously, lore was tied to challenges, we want all players to have a chance to immerse themselves in these stories, so we\u2019ve shifted to a weekly

class=\"bb_paragraph\">replaced \u201cevil within\u201d with two modes that can be toggled with a button press:\u00a0</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><b>stalker mode</b>: 4.2m/s movement speed, undetectable, and can stalk survivors.\u00a0</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><b>pursuer mode</b>: 4.6m/s movement speed, 24m terror radius, increased vault speed, bonuses to lunge range, break speed, and stun recovery, and cannot stalk survivors.\u00a0</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">once the stalk meter is full, <b>evil incarnate</b> mode can be triggered at will, granting the following effects for a limited time (<i>note: survivors no longer become exposed</i>):\u00a0</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">4.6m/s movement speed, 40m terror radius and an increased vault speed.\u00a0</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">unlocks slaughtering strike ability:\u00a0</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">hold the power button to charge this ability, reducing movement speed.\u00a0</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">press the attack button while charging to quickly lunge forward, adjusting your angle as you move. the length of the lunge depends on charge time.\u00a0</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">if a survivor enters the killer\u2019s attack range while lunging, they are knocked into the dying state.\u00a0</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">this ability can also be used to destroy pallets.\u00a0</p></li></ul></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">unlocks the ability to grab and kill or perform a regular mori on survivors who would die the next time they are hooked.\u00a0</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">adjusted some of the mechanics of stalking:\u00a0</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">removed the limited pool of stalk points per survivor.\u00a0</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">reduced stalk range to 32m and removed distance modifier.\u00a0</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">moving while stalking has increased movement speed but incurs a reduced stalk rate.\u00a0</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">reworked his add-ons. \u00a0</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><b>dev note</b>: by moving away from linear \u201cevil within\u201d tiers, we wanted to give players more tools they can use to adapt to each trial\u2019s unique situations, while keeping the core of what makes him \u201cthe shape\u201d.</i>\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>slaughtering strike makes for a high-threat offensive attack, offering up an insta-down opportunity with an extended lunge that's particularly effective in loops and for ripping through pallets quickly.</i>\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>understanding his kit has changed quite a lot, we\u2019ve done a pass on nearly all his add-ons, reworking many of them to offer more unique effects. in particular for those who prefer his old playstyle, fragrant tuft of hair will change evil incarnate to function like old myers, offering an exposed effect and no slaughtering strike. stay tuned for patch notes for the full details on these changes!</i>\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><div

class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">increased activation time of the afterpiece antidote.\u00a0</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">increased how long the afterpiece tonic\u2019s hindered effect lingers after leaving smoke.\u00a0</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><b>dev note</b>: we\u2019ve heard your feedback that the clown\u2019s easier-to-activate haste can make instigating and maintaining chases less interactive for survivors. that, coupled with nerfs to his purple bottles has pushed players towards this frustrating tactic. to make both bottles feel like viable options without being too oppressive, we\u2019ve adjusted the values of their most impactful qualities to strike a balance between pre-9.1.0 values and live values.</i>\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><div class=\"bb_h3\">the unknown\u00a0</div><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0<img

class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><b>dev note</b>: the unknown is largely considered to be fun to play as and against, and we want to preserve that while adapting to the current state of gameplay. we\u2019ve buffed the uvx slightly, while also taking what we learned from the animatronic to allow for orbitals, improving uvx aiming and making for even more fun gameplay.</i>\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>it\u2019s also likely no surprise that blurry photo is the most used add-on for the unknown, given the importance of speed recovery. to help create an opportunity for more add-on experimentation, we\u2019ve converted a portion of this add-on into a basekit buff, while also doing a pass on other add-ons that are due for some adjustments.</i>\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><div class=\"bb_h3\">the dark lord\u00a0</div><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0<img

add-ons.\u00a0</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><b>dev note</b>: vampire form is slightly less oppressive in short loops where movement slowdown had less of an impact, and toning down wolf form\u2019s mobility, which has been outclassing some dash killers. on the flip side, you\u2019ll find bat form easier to control in tighter spaces and can use hellfire slightly more frequently and

secret that it\u2019s been a common pain point for survivors to be locked in place when hit with a kagune leap grab-attack across a vault. survivors shouldn\u2019t have to wait for the ghoul to finish their vault before being able to move again, so we\u2019ve removed this tech.</i>\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><div class=\"bb_h3\">the oni\u00a0</div><p

folks,\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">we have followed your conversations very closely about the state of the game of late, and we agree it\u2019s not in the place we all would like it to be. recent releases, including our most recent, have introduced frustrating new issues which have distracted from your enjoyment of dbd. we wanted to acknowledge this and let you in on the steps we'll be taking to resolve these issues in the short and long term.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><b>next steps</b>\u00a0</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">along with posting this

but we agree we should not wait any longer to activate the kill switch on them and are doing so now.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">we will also make small adjustments to fog vials, decreasing base fog opacity and the volume of ambient fog audio.\u00a0<br />\u00a0</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">another hotfix is underway, scheduled to follow next week. </p></li></ul><p

class=\"bb_paragraph\"><b>processes overhaul</b>\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">as a result of your feedback and internal discussions on the same topic, we will immediately be rebuilding our

to improve this.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">once we've settled on a new process, we will clearly communicate the criteria to trigger a kill switch to make sure your expectations are better in line with our actions.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">finally, we wanted to address the comments made by the team about the kill switch and streetwise. we apologize for how these comments dismissed your feelings about the importance of quickly addressing streetwise and further fanned the flames of an already tense topic.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">we're grateful for your feedback, which helps us identify places where we can improve and re-evaluate our processes, changing course when it's needed to improve the dead by daylight experience for all. as a live game,
